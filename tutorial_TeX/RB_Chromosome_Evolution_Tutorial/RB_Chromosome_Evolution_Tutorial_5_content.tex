\section{Example: A Simple ChromoSSE Analysis}\label{sec:chromosse_analysis}

In this example, we will again use molecular sequence data and chromosome counts from \citet{ohi2006molecular} of the plant genus \textit{Aristolochia}. 
We will use a ChromoSSE model to infer rates of chromosome evolution and ancestral chromosome numbers.
For more complex examples utilizing ChromoSSE with Bayesian model averaging and reversible-jump
MCMC, see the scripts and explanations at \url{https://github.com/wf8/chromosse}.

Like in previous examples, we will here only highlight the major differences between a ChromoSSE
analysis and the ChromEvol analysis set up in Section \ref{sec:chromo_basic_analysis}.
The full script to run this ChromoSSE example is provided in the file \texttt{scripts/ChromoSSE\_simple.Rev}.

\subsection{The Chromosome Evolution Model}

\subsubsection{A Joint Model of the Tree and Chromosome Numbers}

A major difference between the previously discussed models of chromosome number evolution
and ChromoSSE is that ChromoSSE jointly describes the evolution of chromosome numbers
and the tree. Since ChromoSSE assumes the tree is generated via a birth-death process
you should use an ultrametric tree or time-calibrated tree.
The tree may contain lineages that went extinct before the present,
but the branch lengths should be in units of time, as opposed to 
units of substitutions per site.
So here we will swap out the tree used in previous examples for a tree
that was time-calibrated. 
The estimated rates of chromosome evolution will
have the same unit of time as the branch lengths of our tree.
In this example the node ages are relative, but you could
use a fossil-calibrated tree with absolute ages if you wanted
rates of chromosome change in units of millions of years.
{\tt \begin{snugshade*}
\begin{lstlisting}
phylogeny <- readTrees("data/aristolochia-bd.tree")[1]
\end{lstlisting}
\end{snugshade*}
}


\subsubsection{Anagenetic Changes}

The anagenetic part of the chromosome number evolution model involves populating the \texttt{Q} transition rate matrix with the rates of anagenetic chromosome number changes.
This is set up exactly the same as in the ChromEvol analyses before.

\subsubsection{Cladogenetic Changes}

At each lineage splitting event a number of different types of cladogenetic events could occur, including no change in chromosome numbers, a dysploid gain or loss in a single daughter lineage, or a change in ploidy in a single daughter lineage.
So we must set up a separate speciation rate for each type of cladogenetic event.

For each speciation rate, we will use an exponential prior with the mean value set to $r$, where $r$ is an approximation of the net diversification rate.
We calculate this approximation using $E(N_t) = N_0 e^{rt}$,
which describes the expected number of species $N_t$ 
at time $t$ under a constant rate birth-death process
where $N_0$ is the number of species at $t=0$ \citep{nee94}. 
The equation can be rearranged to arrive at
$r = ( \ln(N_t) - \ln(N_0) ) / t$.
{\tt \begin{snugshade*}
\begin{lstlisting}
taxa <- phylogeny.taxa()
speciation_mean <- ln( taxa.size() ) / phylogeny.rootAge()
speciation_pr <- 1 / speciation_mean
\end{lstlisting}
\end{snugshade*}
}
Each cladogenetic event type is assigned its own speciation rate.
We set the rate of demi-polyploidization to 0.0 for simplicity.
{\tt \begin{snugshade*}
\begin{lstlisting}
clado_no_change ~ dnExponential(speciation_pr)
clado_fission ~ dnExponential(speciation_pr)
clado_fusion ~ dnExponential(speciation_pr)
clado_polyploid ~ dnExponential(speciation_pr)
clado_demipoly <- 0.0
\end{lstlisting}
\end{snugshade*}
}
Like usual, we must add MCMC moves for the speciation rates.
{\tt \begin{snugshade*}
\begin{lstlisting}
moves.append( mvScale(clado_no_change, lambda=5.0, weight=1) )
moves.append( mvScale(clado_fission, lambda=5.0, weight=1) )
moves.append( mvScale(clado_fusion, lambda=5.0, weight=1) )
moves.append( mvScale(clado_polyploid, lambda=5.0, weight=1) )
\end{lstlisting}
\end{snugshade*}
}
We next create a vector to hold the speciation rates,
and also create a deterministic node \texttt{total\_speciation}
which will be a convenient way to monitor the total speciation rate
of the birth-death process.
{\tt \begin{snugshade*}
\begin{lstlisting}
speciation_rates := [clado_no_change, clado_fission, clado_fusion, clado_polyploid, clado_demipoly]
total_speciation := sum(speciation_rates)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{snugshade*}
}
Finally, we map the speciation rates to the chromosome cladogenetic events.
The function \texttt{fnChromosomesCladoEventsBD}
produces a matrix of speciation rates. This is a very
large and sparse 3 dimensional matrix that contains the speciation rates 
for all possible cladogenetic events.
It contains the speciation rate for
every possible state of the parent lineage transitioning to every possible
combination of states of the two daughter lineages.
{\tt \begin{snugshade*}
\begin{lstlisting}
clado_matrix := fnChromosomesCladoEventsBD(speciation_rates, max_chromo)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{snugshade*}
}

\subsubsection{Extinction Rate}

Next, we create a stochastic variable to represent the relative-extinction rate.
Here, we define relative-extinction as extinction divided by speciation,
so we use a uniform prior on the interval $\{0,1\}$.
{\tt \begin{snugshade*}
\begin{lstlisting}
rel_extinction ~ dnUniform(0, 1.0)
rel_extinction(0.4)
moves.append( mvScale(rel_extinction, lambda=5.0, weight=3.0) )
\end{lstlisting}
\end{snugshade*}
}
We then make a vector of extinction rates for each state.
In the basic ChromoSSE model we assume all chromosome 
numbers have the same extinction rate.
{\tt \begin{snugshade*}
\begin{lstlisting}
for (i in 1:(max_chromo + 1)) {
    extinction[i] := rel_extinction * total_speciation
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{snugshade*}
}

\subsubsection{The State-Dependent Speciation and Extinction Model}

We are now nearly ready to create the stochastic node that represents
the state-dependent speciation and extinction process.
First, though, we must set the probability of sampling species at the present.
We artificially use 1.0 here, but you should experiment with more realistic settings
as this will affect the overall speciation and extinction rates estimated.
{\tt \begin{snugshade*}
\begin{lstlisting}
rho_bd <- 1.0
\end{lstlisting}
\end{snugshade*}
}
Now we construct a variable that describes the evolution of both the tree and chromosome
numbers drawn from a cladogenetic state-dependent birth-death process.
The \texttt{dnCDCladoBDP} distribution is named for a
character-dependent cladogenetic birth-death process, which is
another name for a cladogenetic state-dependent speciation and extinction process.
{\tt \begin{snugshade*}
\begin{lstlisting}
chromo_bdp ~ dnCDCladoBDP( rootAge            = phylogeny.rootAge(),
                    cladoEventMap             = clado_matrix,
                    extinctionRates           = extinction,
                    Q                         = Q,
                    delta                     = 1.0,
                    pi                        = root_frequencies,
                    rho                       = rho_bd,
                    condition                 = "time",
                    taxa                      = taxa )
\end{lstlisting}
\end{snugshade*}
}
Since ChromoSSE is a joint model of both the tree and the chromosome numbers,
we must of course clamp both the observed tree and the chromosome count data.
{\tt \begin{snugshade*}
\begin{lstlisting}
chromo_bdp.clamp(phylogeny)
chromo_bdp.clampCharData(chromo_data)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{snugshade*}
}

\medskip 
\subsection{Finishing the ChromoSSE Analysis}

The rest of the analysis is nearly identical to the other examples we have worked through,
except for one detail when setting up the ancestral state monitor.
Now we must specify that we are using a state-dependent speciation and extinction
process (as mentioned above this is also called a character-dependent birth-death process, or \texttt{cdbdp})
instead of a continuous-time Markov process (\texttt{ctmc}) like we use before.
{\tt \begin{snugshade*}
\begin{lstlisting}
monitors[2] = mnJointConditionalAncestralState(filename="output/ChromoSSE_anc_states.log", printgen=10, tree=phylogeny, cdbdp=chromo_bdp, withStartStates=true, type="NaturalNumbers")
\end{lstlisting}
\end{snugshade*}
}
And that's it! The results can be plotted using the same R script 
demonstrated before to plot the cladogenetic ChromEvol analysis.
